Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Users can Tweet what's on their mind and their Tweets will populate as a new card for everyone to see. This project is a front-end focused project utilizing HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX, with some additional back-end integration via Node.js and Express.

Additional features of the project include CSS animations, a responsive layout for mobile/desktop viewing, and JS-based modifications to the DOM.
